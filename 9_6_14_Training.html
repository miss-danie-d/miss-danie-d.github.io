<h1>Hey, girl <em>heeeyyyy</em>!</h1> 
	<p class="special"> My name is <span id="username">Danie D</span>.</p> 
	<p> I'm going on a trip next week. I have a bunch of things to do before them. Among them are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Water my plants</li>
		<li>Mop my kitchen floor</li>
		<li>Get rid of perishible foods</li>
		<li> Arrange for shuttles to & from SFO</li>
	</ul>
<p>People started showing up and we wondered where the fireworks would begin. We looked for rooftop displays on both sides of the river, but didn't find anything. Then came the man with the box.</p>

<p>He and his crew showed up around 11:30, hopped the railing and started unspooling wires that we assumed were to be used for detonation. As the show literally unraveled before our eyes, my procedural side wondered if this was even being put on by the city. It could just be that Puente de la Mujer is a place where people come and set up their own displays. I mean there didn't seem to be anything discouraging self expression through pyrotechnics, so who's to say? </p>
